# vuepress-theme-default-vue-a11y

We created a vuepress theme to facilitate the maintenance of the documentation for Vue-a11y, it is a work in progress, but it is available for anyone who wants to use and contribute.

It does not replace the default vuepress theme, however, this theme contains most Vue-a11y packages and some plugins to improve semantics and accessibility in the documentation.
