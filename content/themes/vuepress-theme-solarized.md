The Solarized theme for Vuepress

## Features

-   **Customizable typography**: Import and use your favorite web-fonts. Customize font sizes and text-adjustment for body text
-   **Dark and light themes**: With a theme-switcher and native theme detection to set the theme automatically as per the user preference

## Demo

I'm too busy to create a proper demo, but you can take a look at my [Blog/Notes](https://puritanic.github.io/CompSci/) webpage if you want to see how it's looking.

## Get Started

Add the dependency to your existing Vuepress project via Yarn or NPM.

```sh
yarn add -D vuepress-theme-solarized
npm install -D vuepress-theme-solarized
```

Update `.vuepress/config.js` as follows.

```js
module.exports = {
	theme: 'vuepress-theme-solarized',
	globalUIComponents: ['ThemeManager'],
};
```

`ThemeManager` provides theme-switching functionality across the app.

Note that you can also use the shorthand name for the theme.

```js
module.exports = {
	theme: 'solarized',
	globalUIComponents: ['ThemeManager'],
};
```
