# VuePress theme - Gitbook inspired

A [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org) theme inspired by [Gitbook](https://docs.gitbook.com/).

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

[Live demo](https://vuepress-theme-book.netlify.app)

I really love their clean and minimalist style, so I decided to do a theme for VuePress.

It is **not** 100% identical to a Gitbook page, some choices are made to respect VuePress limitations.
It is based on `@vuepress/theme-default` and I only extend it.

You can see a **live demo** on the [demo website](https://vuepress-theme-book.netlify.app)

## Using the Theme
