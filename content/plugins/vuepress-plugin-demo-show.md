# Introduction

`Demo show` is a `Vuepress-based` plug-in, which can help you add `Vue` examples when writing documents. Its original intention is to reduce the difficulty of adding some related examples when writing component documents.

This plug-in is been partially modified according to my development needs based on [`Demo Container`](https://github.com/calebman/vuepress-plugin-demo-container).

The usage method is the same as that of `Demo Container`, the description document can refer to [Demo-Container example and usage document](https://docs.chenjianhui.site/vuepress-plugin-demo-container/zh/)。

Thanks to the original author [chenjianhui](https://github.com/calebman/vuepress-plugin-demo-container)！
