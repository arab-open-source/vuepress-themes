# vuepress-theme-ktquez
A blog theme for VuePress by Ktquez ðŸ¤˜ðŸ¤˜

> Vuepress does not yet have native support for blogs, but this theme has some practices and customizations to turn into a blog.

## Vuepress theme ktquez starter

I know the theme configuration seems like a lot of work though, I've created a [boilerplate](https://github.com/ktquez/vuepress-theme-ktquez-starter) with the settings and structure of folders organized, just clone the repository and change the information for your blog, modify the images and start using.

## Installation

```shell
npm install -S vuepress-theme-ktquez
```

## Configuration

The theme customization is done through the `.vuepress/config.js`  
For your reference, you can see the [config.js of my blog](https://github.com/ktquezplay/webapp/blob/master/src/.vuepress/config.js). 

```javascript
module.exports = {
  theme: 'ktquez',
  ...
  locales: {              // Example with multiple locales, but usually works only with a single locale
    '/': {
      lang: 'en'
    },
    '/pt/': {
      lang: 'pt-br'
    },
    '/es/': {
      lang: 'es'
    }
  },
  themeConfig: // example below
  configureWebpack () {
    return {
      resolve: {
        alias: {
          '@public': path.join(__dirname, './public')
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### themeConfig

```javascript
themeConfig: {
  locales: {
    '/': {
      languages: {                              // Used in the drop down of languages
        label: 'English', 
        shortname: 'EN' 
       }, 
      translation: {},                          // Look for the "translations section" below
      logo: {

          items: [

              label: 'ABOUT',
              path: '/about/'                         // Use "link" for external links and "path" for internal links
            },
            ...
          ]
        },

      social: [

        label: 'Portuguese', 
        shortname: 'PT' 
      },
      ...  // the rest of the properties of this locale are the same as the example above, but with information for that language
    },
    '/es/': ...

    active: true,                       // Turn on responsive images on the cover of the post
    ext: 'png',
    breakpoints: [320, 427, 524, 680]   // Breakpoints used for picture media tag
  },
  share: {
    facebook: { appId: '', version: 'v3.1' }
  },
  elevator: { duration: 4000, mainAudio: '/music/elevator.mp3', endAudio: '/music/ding.mp3' }
},

```



## Translations of the theme

The texts that are in the theme are translated and currently the theme has included the translations for `EN` and` PT`, any other language you will use, just add the `key: value` in the translation property that the theme will do rest for you.

```js
themeConfig: {
  locales: {
    '/es/': {
      languages: { label: 'Spanish', shortname: 'ES' },
      translation: {
        back: 'AtrÃ¡s',
        home: 'Home',
        author: 'Autor',
        ...
      }
    },
    '/fr/': {
      languages: { label: 'French', shortname: 'FR' },
      translation: {
        back: 'arriÃ¨re',
        home: 'Page d\'accueil',
        author: 'auteur',
        ...
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For you to see all the `key: value` used in the theme, just access [this example](https://github.com/ktquez/vuepress-theme-ktquez/blob/master/plugins/Translation/locales/en.js)


## Newsletter

To make the newsletter form appear, simply add the action of your newsletter.  

```js
themeConfig: {
  locales: {
    ...
    '/': {
      ...
      newsletter: {
        provider: 'mailchimp',
        action: 'MY_ACTION_FOR_ENGLISH_USERS'
      },
    },
    '/pt/': {
      ...
      newsletter: {
        provider: 'mailchimp',
        action: '' // Does not display the form if you leave an empty string
      }
    }
  }
  ...
}
```

## Responsive post cover

To improve UX and performance, the blog supports responsive images through breakpoints.

```js
themeConfig: {
  ...
  responsive: {
    active: true, // Turn on responsive images on the cover of the post
    ext: 'png',
    breakpoints: [320, 427, 524, 680] // Breakpoints used for picture media tag
  },
  ...
}
```

With the example above, you need to insert the images with the final `,w_XXX`, for example:

If your post is: `/posts/my-first-post.md`  
Your images should be in `public/images/posts/__YEAR__/__MONTH__/` and with the following sizes:
- `public/images/posts/2018/8/my-first-post,w_320.png`
- `public/images/posts/2018/8/my-first-post,w_427.png`
- `public/images/posts/2018/8/my-first-post,w_524.png`
- `public/images/posts/2018/8/my-first-post,w_680.png`
- `public/images/posts/2018/8/my-first-post.png` 

**If you don't want to use responsive images, simply disable and to use `public/images/posts/2018/8/my-first-post.png`**

**There are `key: value` in [translations of routes](https://github.com/ktquez/vuepress-theme-ktquez/blob/master/plugins/Translation/locales/en.js#L46), if you do not have your language or want to rename, just add in translation translation**

# Override CSS (Stylus)

To overwrite the theme variables to customize colors and etc, simply create a file in `.vuepress/override.styl`, por exemplo:

```stylus
$primaryColor = #AE4967
$accentColor = #35495E

$color1 = #41b883
$colorImageFallback = $accentColor

$firstFooterColor = #35495E
$secondFooterColor = #263647
```

**To see all the variables, [access this link](https://github.com/ktquez/vuepress-theme-ktquez/blob/master/styles/config.styl)**

# The best pratice of accessibility includes

The theme uses some plugins from the [Vue A11y project](https://github.com/vue-a11y)
- [Vue announcer](https://github.com/vue-a11y/vue-announcer);
- [Vue skip to](https://github.com/vue-a11y/vue-skip-to);

In addition to good practices such as:
- Nocturne mode
- Customization of alternative texts in images;
- Card posts with descriptive links using aria-labelledby;
- Among others

# Lazy-load

It is possible to delay media loading using the global component \<lazy-load\>.

In any markdown files you can to use this component, for example load a Youtube video

```html
<lazy-load tag="iframe" :data="{ src: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv1ItUzktc' }" />
```

Or for images:

```html
<lazy-load tag="img" :data="{ src: 'https://octodex.github.com/images/stormtroopocat.jpg', alt: 'The Stormtroopocat' }" />
```

This component uses the [IntersectionObserver API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) to display the elements.
You can check [this link for support of this API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API#Browser_compatibility)

If you want to use and support older browsers, you can use [this polyfill](https://github.com/w3c/IntersectionObserver)


# And more

## Anaytics campaign in posts

All posts sharing icons links are included in analytics campaign parameters.  
`?utm_source=SOCIALNAMECLICKED&utm_medium=share&utm_campaign=single-post`

> With this you can analyze the interaction and shares of your posts.

## Fonts

The theme have as fonts:
- [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) - All site
- [Hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/) - For code blocks

> To overwrite the fonts, simply use the `.vuepress/style.styl`. [Ver doc vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/default-theme-config/#migrate-your-styles-to-style-styl)

**This theme adopts the strategy to load Web fonts using FontFaceObserver**

## Assets

You can copy some assets from the [public folder of the theme](https://github.com/ktquez/vuepress-theme-ktquez/tree/master/public), they server for you to configure some images as well as files to turn your blog into a PWA (for example the file [manifest.json](https://github.com/ktquez/vuepress-theme-ktquez/tree/master/public)).


## Ads

You can also insert ads in the blog, which are displayed in the sidebar of the home page and the right side of the post.
Ads are built through an array of objects that we can insert into each themeConfig locale, [example taken from my personal blog](https://github.com/ktquezplay/webapp/blob/master/src/.vuepress/config/locales/en/ads.js)

For example:

```js
themeConfig: {
  locales: {
    ...
    '/': {
      ...
      ads: [
        {
          text: 'Did you know that Udemy has more than 300 web development courses for only R $ 21.99?',
          link: 'http://bit.ly/web-development-udemy',
          image: {
            src: '/web-development-english.png',
            alt: 'Illustration of a user studying online'
          },
          by: {
            text: 'udemy.com',
            link: 'http://bit.ly/all-courses-udemy'
          }
        }
