1. Install
    ```
    yarn add vuepress-theme-inherit
    ```

    ```
    .
    ├── docs
    │   ├── tags
    │   │   └── README.md
    │   ├── archives
    │   │   └── README.md
    │   ├── post
    │   │   └── README.md
    |   |
    ```
3. Add the following configration in the `config.js` to import the theme and generate the navigation bar.
    ```
    theme: 'vuepress-theme-inherit',
    themeConfig: {
      nav: [
        ...
        {text: 'blog', link: '/post/'},
        {text: 'tags', link: '/tags/'},
        {text: 'archives', link: '/archives/'},
        ...
      ]
    },
    ```
4. Add the following keywords in the blog markdown file [Front Matter](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/frontmatter.html)  to let the script sort

    3. `tags` is used to filter the tags.
    4. Blog homepage will create the blog list, base on the markdown files you created under the `/post` directory automatically.
